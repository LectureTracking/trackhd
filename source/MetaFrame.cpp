/*
 * This file will contain all data that needs to pass through to the following stages.
 * This data includes:
 * 1) Video information such as:
 *      - Length (float)
 *      - Frame Rate (int)
 *      - Processing/Detection rate (e.g Every 60 frames) and this will be the interval of the metadata
 * 2) Areas of motion
 *      - Stored as an array of rectangles
 *      - [rect(sx,sy,ex,ey);...]
 *
 * 3) Blackboard columns
 *      - Stored as a vector of rectangles
 *
 * 4) Blackboard column usage
 *      - Detect writing on blackboard
 *      - Used boards stored as index from 3 above
 *      - E.g [0,1,3] Index in rectangle vector
 *
 * 5) Grayscale Video
